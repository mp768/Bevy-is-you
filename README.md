# Bevy is you

A clone of the puzzle game "Baba is you" made in the Bevy game engine for the Rust programming language :)

# Installation

## If you have cargo installed:
clone the repo with 
```
git clone git@github.com:mp768/Bevy-is-you.git
```
and just run
```
cargo run
```

## If you do not have cargo installed:
install cargo using the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

I'd also recommend reading the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) if you're unfamiliar with rust :)
